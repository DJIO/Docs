DMS was designed from the beginning to be a 'better way' to build themes. The reason for this is that while most themes are static code, DMS is dynamic and fluid. This allows designers to build websites and then seamlessly convert them to themes with a few clicks.

Once a theme is created you can then sell it on the PageLines Store or simply give it away to your site visitors as a freebie.
