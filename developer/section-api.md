# Section API #

PageLines Section API allows developers to use their imagination to create their own unique sections for extra functionality as well as offering these sections to other PageLines users via the [PageLines Store](http://www.pagelines.com/store).

Using the API, you can define what kind of content the sections contains, what kind of options are available such as image uploaders, padding control and more.

## Required Files ##
