# Upgrading & Migration #

In this tutorial, we will show you how to migrate from Platform Pro and PageLines Framework, as well as upgrade from the open source version of DMS to the Premium version.

## Migrating from Platform Pro ##

Unfortunately, there is no upgrade path for users of Platform or Platform Pro and instead you will need to migrate to PageLines DMS. What this means is that you will need to recreate your sites design again using PageLines DMS. The average time to make the switch ranges from five minutes to a few hours depending on the level of customization that was previously applied to the website. That said, there are still a few things you should be aware of when upgrading.

### Database Untouched ###

Your content such as pages and posts will remain intact, in the database upon installation and activation of PageLines DMS.

### CSS Changes ###

While developing PageLines DMS, it is very difficult to prevent CSS changes from happening. This means that you may need to review your custom CSS and make some adjustments, correcting your custom CSS rules to align with the new elements.

### Migration Steps ###

* Back up your database.
* Copy any custom CSS, functions and any other code you may have added into a code editor.
* Move all of your widgets to the “**inactive”** area at the bottom **Appearance &rarr; Widgets**.
* Follow these instructions on how to [install & activate PageLines DMS](http://docs.pagelines.com/getting-started/installation).
* Re-establish your WordPress menus **Appearance &rarr; Menus** and click **Save**.
* Move all of your widgets back to the desired locations **Appearance &rarr; Widgets**.
* Visit each tab of the DMS Toolbar and adjust the settings to your liking (don’t forget to enter your account info too!).
* Paste your custom CSS, functions, etc, that you copied earlier back into your site.
* There are three ways to do this, for more information see our [How to Customize](http://docs.pagelines.com/customize/how-to-customize/) doc.

## Migrating from PageLines Framework ##

Like Platform Pro, there isn't an upgrade path and you will need to migrate. However, we have included a option **DMS Toolbar &rarr; Global Options &Rarr; Advanced **Framework V2 Upgrade**, using this option enables PageLines Framework backend interface and options. Not all PageLines Framework options work in DMS due to specificity; but it allows you to reference your old settings as you are rebuilding your site using the DMS system.

### Database Untouched ###

Your content such as pages and posts will remain intact, in the database upon installation and activation of PageLines DMS.

## Upgrading From DMS Lite

After your purchase of PageLines DMS has been completed, log in to your website's WordPress admin dashboard.

* Navigate **PageLines &rarr; Account**.
* Enter your PageLines **username** and **password**.
* Once successfully logged in, it will state **PageLines DMS enabled**.
* Go back to your WordPress Dashboard. You should see a notice at the top of the screen (see graphic below).
* Click **Update Now**.
* Under the **Themes** tab, check the box next to **PageLines** and click **Update Themes**.
* Once updated, you will have successfully upgraded to the premium version of PageLines DMS.

`PageLines DMS Version 3.X is available. You should Update Now.
