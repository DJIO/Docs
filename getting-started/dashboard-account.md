# Dashboard #

The PageLines Dashboard is accessible by logging into your WordPress dashboard. The main idea of the PageLines Dashboard is to give you a place where you can get an overview of all PageLines-related news and account information.

## Updates ##

The **Updates** panel allows you to keep up-to-date with all the latest news from the PageLines blog and the PageLines community, as well as new Store items.

## Plus Extensions ##

The **Plus Extensions** panel provides a list of all available extensions available when you have an active PageLines Plus subscription.

**Note:** In order to use these extensions, an active [PageLines Plus](http://www.pagelines.com/plus) subscription is required. The sections can also be purchased individually from the [PageLines Store](http://www.pagelines.com/store).

## Live Chat ##

The **Live Chat** panel provides access to PageLines Live Chat, which is a moderated chat where the PageLines Team members can assist with your product questions. Only PageLines Plus members get access to the Live Chat.

### Sign in to Live Chat ###

Make sure you are signed in to your PageLines account and your PageLines Plus subscription is active. Live chat can be accessed from the **Live Chat** tab on your PageLines Dashboard.

### Live Chat Usage ###

Please note no customization support is provided via Live Chat. However, you can use the moderators' assistance for:

* Installation
* Integrations
* Layout Issues
* Setup
* Product Support

All customization related questions including HTML, CSS, PHP and so on, need to be addressed in the [PageLines Support Forums](http://www.pagelines.com/forum).

## Your Account ##

The **Your Account** panel allows you to log into your PageLines account. This activates the Professional product features and lets you receive automatic updates and easily install Store products. It also gives you access to Live Chat, if you are a Plus client.

If you have an active Plus subscription, this information will also be visible in the notification message.
