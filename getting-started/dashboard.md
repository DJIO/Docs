# Dashboard #

The PageLines Dashboard is accessible by logging into your Wordpress dashboard. The main idea of the PageLines Dashboard is to give you a place where you can get at-a-galnce overview of all PageLines related news and account information.

You can catchup on the latest news from both the PageLines community and store, view all PageLines Plus extensions, access to Live Chat, resources & support and your account.

## Updates ##

The **Updates** panel allows you to keep up-to-date with all the latest news from the PageLines blog and the PageLines community.

As well as the latest PageLines news, you can also keeping up-to-date with the latest PageLines store updates and extensions.

**Note:** In order to use these extensions, an active [PageLines Plus](http://www.pagelines.com/plus) subscription is required. Without a Plus subscription however, you may purchase these extensions individually via the PageLines store.
