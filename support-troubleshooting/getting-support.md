# Getting Support #

PageLines' mission is to create awesome experiences for everyone in our community. We provide a variety of resources and tools to provide you the best possible support available. Each support resource focuses on a specific area, that we'll explain below.

## Support Scope ##

### Documentation ##

One of the best ways to learn PageLines DMS, is to read through all its documentation, which has guides, tutorials and examples to assist you. Our documentation is now hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pagelines/Docs/) and open to the public, allowing the PageLines community to contribute; making edits or corrections, and [reporting issues](https://github.com/pagelines/Docs/issues) which can be used to notifiy the docs team about bugs, duplicates, enhancements, questions and so forth. With this feedback, we can improve and maintain accurate, up to date documentation.

### PageLines Helpdesk ###

The primary purpose of the PageLines helpdesk is to resolve any questions related to pre-sales and account & billing. Any technical questions will receive an auto response, informing the recipient, that all technical questions should be asked in our support forums.
