# How to use the Visual Editor 

The Pagelines visual editor is the core feature for Pagelines DMS. Before using the editor for the first time, you’ll need to populate your site with content. This will make the editor easier to work with. 

The visual editor is made up of two parts. An interactive preview window at the top of the screen and the DMS control panel at the bottom.

The preview screen is spilt into a series of containers, header, footer, main column and sidebar.  The blue guidelines in the preview window show the boundaries for each container. 

## How to use the DMS control Panel 

The DMS control panel can be accessed by clicking on the toolbar at the bottom of your screen and contains the following admin panels. 

Add sections>Page templates>Global options>custom code>theme>support>store>preview and publish. 

## Adding sections using the visual editor 

To populate the containers on your site with Pagelines sections. Click on the DMS control panel and select the ‘add sections’ tab. The list of available sections will populate admin panel. 

Click on the required section and drag it out into the preview window. Drop the section into the required position in the layout. To move a section to a new position in the layout, click and drag to a new location.  

Once the section is in place, use the tool bar at the top of the section block to edit the width, access the section settings, clone or delete. 

## Disabling the visual editor 

To turn off the visual editor, select the power in the DMS control panel. 

## Previewing a page 

To preview your page without the visual editor grid guidelines select the preview icon from the DMS control panel.
