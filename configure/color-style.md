# Color & Style #

The **Color & style** panel provides the ability to easily change the color of your Content base, main text and links. Colors can be inputted via the color chooser pop-up selector or manually using a hex code in the input field. 

You also have the ability to configure your background using an image with settings allowing control over repeat, position, attachment and fit to screen.

### Content Base & Site Text Colors ###

The **Content base** color is used as your background and as a basis for calculating contrast values in elements such as hover effects, etc. Use it as your default background color and refine using custom CSS/LESS or a theme.

The Site text colors setting allows you to configure the basic text colors for your site.

### Background Image Settings ###

If you would prefer to set the background to something other than a single color; you can upload your own image.

1. Browse your computer and locate your background image.
2. Click **Upload Image**.
3. Once uploaded, a preview of your image will be visible.

**Fit image to page?**

If you use this option the image will be fit **responsively** to the background of your page. This means the settings below will have no effect.

* **Vertical Position in Percent** allows you to move the image down the page
* **Horizontal Position in Percent** allows you to move the image to right of the page
