# Advanced #

The **Advanced** panel contains some additional options that can be useful to solve some specific issues when developing your site.

### Google Prettify Code ###

Checking this box will enable a class of `prettyprint` to `<code>` or `<pre>` tags, or optionally use the `[pl_codebox]` shortcode. Wrap the codebox shortcode using `[pl_raw]` if Wordpress inserts line breaks.

### PageLines Affiliate/Partner Link ###

If you are a [PageLines Partner](http://www.pagelines.com/partners/) you can enter your Partner Link here to change the PageLines logo on your site to be an affiliate link.

If you are not a PageLines Partner you can [sign up](http://www.impactradius.com/campaign-campaign-info/PageLines-Partner-Program.brand) and earn a referral for every sale you generate through your link.

### Current Install Class ###

Use this option to add a class to the `<body>` element of the website. This can be useful when using the same child theme on several installations or sub domains and can be used to control CSS customizations.
