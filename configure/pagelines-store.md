# PageLines Store #

From time-to-time you may want to add a plugin, a section or even a child theme. The PageLines Store provides unique products, all built, designed and tested to work within PageLines DMS. This is your one-stop shop for great amenities to improve your site.

The Store is an incredible asset, full of important resources to improve the quality of your website. We're sure you will enjoy it and keep an eye on it for new products, which are added often.  It's also a place where you can find and upgrade products, and activate plugins found via the Store.

## Accessing the store ##

To access the Store, you may purchase direct from our [website](http://www.pagelines.com/store) or, for easier installation and integration, simply access the Store tab from the PageLines Toolbar to find the products you need. You can purchase them directly, or if you're a Plus subscriber, get your Plus Extensions here, too.

The Store has four basic departments: Sections; Plugins; Themes; and Integrations.

## Installing Store Products

Pagelines DMS allows you to extend the functionality of your site by adding new sections, these are available from the Pagelines Store. 

To access the store and see which products are available, you can either click on the sections icon in the DMS control panel and select ‘get more sections’. 

Or select the extend icon directly in the DMS control panel.
