Pagelines DMS allows you to extend the functionality of your site by adding new sections, these are available from the Pagelines Store. 

To access the store and see which products are available, you can either click on the sections icon in the DMS control panel and select ‘get more sections’. 

Or select the extend icon directly in the DMS control panel.

Select the image for the product you want to add and you will be taken to the product overview page. Here you can click to purchase the product, go to the full product over on Pagelines.com or close the window to return to the store.

Once purchased your product will be added to the ‘your sections’ tab, where you can drag it to the required position in the layout.
