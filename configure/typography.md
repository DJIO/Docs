# Typography #

The **Typography** panel provides the ability to change font size, weight as well as the default font family used on your website. 

**Primary Text** allows you to style the standard type of your site. **Text Headers** allows you to style your site’s header tags (H1, H2, H3…) 

### Select Font ###

The Select font dropdown menu allows you to choose from many popular web fonts. The whole Google web fonts library can be included by installing our [Google Web fonts plugin](http://www.pagelines.com/store/plugins/pagelines-googlefonts/), available from the **Store** tab in the DMS toolbar.

### Base Font Size ###

The Base font size setting allows you to select the size of your text from `10px-30px`. This size is a reference that will be scaled for text used throughout the site. 

### Font Weight ####

The Font weight setting allows you to select the weight of your text from `Light (300)*`, `Normal (400)`, `Semi-Bold (600)*` and `Bold (800)`.

*Please be aware that these font weights don't always have an effect.
