# Sections Overview #

## Configuring Sections ##

Once you have your section in place on the layout, you will need to set the section options. To access the options for each section, hover over the top of the section in the layout so you see the section control panel, then select the edit icon. The options for that section will appear in the DMS control panel below.

When you have set your section options, select the tick icon on the far right of the DMS control panel to republish the page and save your settings.

## Section Column Control ##

At the top of each section container in the layout you can access the section options, where you can adjust the width, offset size or delete. Hover at the top of the section container to see the section control options appear. 

### Width ###

On the left of the sections control use the left and right arrows to increase or decrease the width of the section. The figure displayed inbetween the arrows indicates the width as a span value, these values are based on a 12 column layout.

### Offset size ###

To fine tune the position of a section inside a column or container, you can use the offset option. Use the left and right arrows to adjust the alignment within the container.

### Force to a new row ###

Sometimes if you have sections nestled or positioned next to one another, you might want to move one down into the next available row. To do this click on the double arrow icon in section control options.

## Clone a section ##

Pagelines DMS will allow you clone sections multiple times within your layout. To clone a section first locate it in the preview window. Hover over the section to access the section control panel at the top and select the clone icon on the right. The cloned section will then be added to the layout. Drag the cloned section into the required position in the layout.
