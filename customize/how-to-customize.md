# How to Customize #

In this tutorial we'll show you how to start customizing PageLines DMS, using one of three methods, and recommend which tools you'll need to learn to make minor or advanced modifications.

## Choosing the right Customization Method ##

There are three methods for adding customization to your website, these are: the **DMS toolbar → Customize options**; the **Base Child theme**, and, the **PageLines Customize plugin**. Each method has pros and cons, which we'll go through below.

### DMS ###

PageLines DMS has two built-in options for customization, allowing you to add custom LESS/CSS, and scripts. If you wish to add a few custom scripts and/or basic CSS/LESS to your website and nothing more, then using DMS independently is the method for you.

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed">
	<thead>
		<tr>
			<th></th>
			<th>Safe from updates</th>
			<th>CSS/LESS</th>
			<th>Hooks</th>
			<th>Override Sections</th>
		</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>DMS Customize Options</td>
			<td><i class="icon-ok text-success"></td>
			<td><i class="icon-ok text-success"></td>
			<td><i class="icon-remove text-error"></td>
			<td><i class="icon-remove text-error"></td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

### PageLines Customize Plugin ###

The Customize Plugin contains both style.css and functions.php files like a child theme, it also supports style.less and the use of hooks. However, the plugin doesn’t support the use of child sections. Localizations and language file options are added to this plugin.

### The Base Theme Child ###

The Base theme is a free child theme available from the PageLines Store which will never receive an update, as its been designed as a base for you to create your very own child themes, as well customizing PageLines DMS.

The Base child theme is considered the most professional method for customizing, as it supports custom CSS/LESS, scripts, hooks and custom/child sections.
